# Prediction-Using-Supervised-Learning
My GitHub project uses Scikit-learn to predict student performance based on study time. It's a practical example of machine learning, open-source for easy collaboration, and great for those new to the field.
# Dataset
In this project, a small dataset with two variables - hours studied and corresponding percentage of marks - has been used. The data, which comprises of 25 observations, is available in a CSV file named data.csv. 
# Evaluation
The model used in the project is a linear regression model, trained using the LinearRegression class from the Scikit-learn (sklearn) library, which assumes a linear relationship between the input and output variables. To evaluate the performance of the model, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics have been used, which are printed to the console along with the predicted values.
